# FullStack-WordleClone
This Is a clone game of Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) 

Not great at front end stuff, so a lot of help with Chat to get css looking good. This project took me a lot longer than i expected because im a novice when it comes to front end. But let me know what fixes can be made

Im aware of some bugs, but i dont have time to fix it because of school. Thanks and enjoy this clone

Also, if you decide to clone this project, this was a public api that requires no key.
